![Alt text](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*OKpwa8G0_ZpZBVr0d0ONzA.png)

The main component in the MVVM design pattern are :

View - Informs the ViewModel about the userâ€™s actions
ViewModel - Exposes streams of data relevant to the View
DataModel - Abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
