# Architecture Design
![mvvm-architecture.png](https://postimg.cc/4HN8GmG3)

The main component in the MVVM design pattern are :

View - Informs the ViewModel about the userâ€™s actions
ViewModel - Exposes streams of data relevant to the View
DataModel - Abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
