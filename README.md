# Architecture Design
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MindorksOpenSource/MVVM-Architecture-Android-Beginners/master/assets/mvvm-arch.png") 

The main component in the MVVM design pattern are :

View - Informs the ViewModel about the userâ€™s actions
ViewModel - Exposes streams of data relevant to the View
DataModel - Abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
